First, click the code option and select download zip, then the zip file will be downloaded, after that extract it to "BotGhostStatusRemover" using 7zip or WinZip. Then you can open the java file with any code editor and run it. I recommend using Visual Studio Code, link is here: https://code.visualstudio.com/Download. Finally, setup visual studio code and run the index.js file, keep in mind that replace the places where I have mentioned special things like write here and put here. Keep your bot formal. Thank you!
